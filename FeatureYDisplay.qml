    @brief   Dynamic Acoustic Environment for customizing the vehicle's interior sound.

    The Dynamic Acoustic Environment feature represents a groundbreaking advancement in
    vehicle interior design, offering an unparalleled auditory experience. It leverages
    advanced sound technology to create immersive soundscapes within the vehicle, ranging
    from calming nature sounds to energizing cityscapes, tailored to the driver's preference,
    current mood, or driving scenario.

    This system can dynamically adjust the acoustic settings to reduce road noise, enhance
    music clarity, or even simulate different driving environments for an enhanced sensory
    experience. Whether navigating through busy city streets or cruising on a highway,
    the Dynamic Acoustic Environment transforms the cabin into a sanctuary of sound.

    Integrating seamlessly with the car's infotainment system, users can select preferences
    through an intuitive interface, making it a perfect addition to luxury and custom vehicles
    focused on delivering a unique and personalized driving experience.
