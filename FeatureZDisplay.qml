    @brief   Holographic Heads-Up Display (HUD) for advanced vehicle interaction and information.

    The Holographic HUD revolutionizes how drivers interact with their vehicles and the road ahead.
    By projecting vital information and 3D interactive elements directly onto the windshield,
    drivers can stay informed and focused without taking their eyes off the road. This feature
    integrates seamlessly with the vehicle's navigation, ADAS, and infotainment systems to display
    real-time data, such as navigation directions, vehicle speed, safety alerts, and even augmented
    reality enhancements to highlight road hazards.

    Designed for the utmost in luxury and customization, the Holographic HUD can be personalized
    to display information according to the driver's preferences, offering different themes and
    layouts. It emphasizes safety, convenience, and a futuristic driving experience, making it a
    standout feature for any high-end vehicle.
