    @brief   Ambient Wellness Monitor for enhancing driver comfort and wellbeing.

    The Ambient Wellness Monitor is a cutting-edge feature designed for luxury and
    custom aftermarket vehicles, focusing on the driver's comfort and wellbeing. It
    intelligently adjusts the vehicle's interior environment - including temperature,
    air quality, and ambient lighting - to optimize driving conditions.

    Utilizing external weather data, time of day, and biometric feedback, the system
    ensures the cabin environment promotes alertness during long drives or relaxation
    in heavy traffic. Unique visual indicators represent the system's current focus,
    such as air purification, temperature adjustment, or mood-enhancing lighting,
    providing drivers with a bespoke luxury experience.

    This component demonstrates how modern vehicles can integrate advanced technology
    to create a more enjoyable and health-conscious driving experience.
