    @brief   Sensory Climate Control for a fully immersive cabin experience.

    Sensory Climate Control revolutionizes the in-cabin environment, providing passengers
    with a unique and personalized climate experience. By leveraging real-time data from
    external weather conditions, internal sensors, and biometric feedback, it adjusts
    various sensory elements such as temperature, humidity, ambient lighting, and even
    cabin scents to enhance comfort and well-being.

    This feature can simulate a cool, crisp morning during a hot drive or a warm, cozy
    atmosphere amidst a cold journey, complete with corresponding scents like fresh
    pine or warm cinnamon. It's designed to transform every journey into a sensory
    adventure, making it an essential luxury for discerning drivers and passengers.

    Integration with the vehicle's infotainment system allows for intuitive control
    and customization, ensuring that the Sensory Climate Control is as enjoyable as it
    is groundbreaking.
